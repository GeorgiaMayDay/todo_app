## A TODO APP IN GO

Works in the command line and is threadsafe (kind of)

To set up, in one terminal window go to 
"..todo_app/cmd/web_server" 
and run
"go run main.go"

Then a seperate one, where the cli will be set up
"..todo_app/cmd/cli"
and run
"go run main.go"

The cli will then show you the instructions for how the cli works!
